## Helper
This is an open-source tool written in Ruby ,that  checks the diffrence between 2 files (especially for competitive programming) 

---
##Execution steps :

you need to install the colorize gem by runing this command : gem install colorize

then run the script with the command : ruby "script path" and just follow the instructions 

"Idlness Limit Excedeed" ==>means that the script did not find the file so either the path you entered is not valid or you did not genrate any
                            output file
                            
                            
The tool is still not complete .... In addition the script gives you an idea about the execution time spent to verify the files
